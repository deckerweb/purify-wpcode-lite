## Description 

This plugin **removes** all the promotional / upsell stuff that WPCode Lite is stuffing within itself and the WordPress Admin Area. That way you are **not distracted** and can **actually just USE** the free lite version of this snippet manager plugin.

Beyond that a few tiny little styling tweaks are made:
* Increase the snippet title input field font size
* Make snippet type selection more colorful to immediately grasp which snippet type would be considered

Nothing more, nothing less.

It may seem not much but the removing of "stuff" and these colorful enhancements will make the difference, believe me.

## Frequently Asked Questions 

### **Why did I even bother and create such a plugin/snippet?** 

When working on a client site other options were not possible or allowed (reasons don't matter here) and I had to use WPCode Lite. While this plugin works just fine, all the promotional "things" and the aggressive upselling got on my nerves in a way that I had to do something about it. The result of that "something" you can see and install here. ðŸ˜‰

It's completely up to you to buy the Pro Version of WPCode. I love premium plugins and have nothing against them. What I do NOT love is taking over the WordPress Admin and aggressively pressuring on my nerves when I have serious work to do. Period.


### Does this plugin add any new features? 

No. Beside a few tiny styling enhancements and tweaks to the Admin Bar / Toolbar items, nothing more gets added. This is intentional. If you don't want my "purify" plugin/snippet you can buy the WPCode Pro version or look for any other alternative.


### Is WPCode Lite any good? 

Yes. It is a great plugin with some great and unique features. It works very well even in the free version.

## Plugin Scope / Disclaimer

This plugin comes as is.

_Disclaimer 1:_ So far I will support the plugin for breaking errors to keep it working. Otherwise support will be very limited. Also, it will NEVER be released to WordPress.org Plugin Repository for a lot of reasons (ah, thanks, Matt!).

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Enjoy your code snippet work again. And now, have fun building great sites!!! ðŸ˜‰
